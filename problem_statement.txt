My goals in this project are to create a patcher for Mabinogi that is user friendly and easy to maintain, and to complete the patcher within 6 weeks. In being easy to maintain, the patcher will be capable of updating itself to apply fixes and additions to itself as needed. The patcher will update and launch Mabinogi, as well as show update progress while patching. Since the patcher will need to be able to update itself, the patcher will consist of a dll made in C# which will be launched by an updater made in C++. The C++ updater is a previous project that needs to be cleaned up and setup to launch the dll. This project will be successful if it is able to properly implement the goals mentioned previously, and the patcher is used for a long period of time without need for many fixes. The main constraint for this project will be time, so I will need to manage my time appropriately across the next 6 weeks. I'm assuming the C++ program I have already made will be easy to setup and will launch the dll properly. I am also assuming that I can complete this project within the next six weeks without issues. The stakeholders for this project will be users of the patcher, my classmates, my teacher, and possible future employers. 

My timeline for this project is as follows:

The first week I will research making a forms application in dll form with C#, create an outline, setup git, and setup this readme.
The second week I will setup the C++ updater to launch the dll, test the updater with the launcher, and adjust this readme. 
The third week I will desgin the gui and setup the start button for future troubleshooting.
The fourth week I will start setting up the logic for patching and test as needed.
The fifth week I will finish the logic for patching and start working on gui functionality.
The final week I will finish working on gui functionality, and I will also test and revise as needed for bugs. I will most likely have others test for bugs that I do not find.
